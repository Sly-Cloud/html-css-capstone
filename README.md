<h6>First Capstone Project</h6>

This is a Psych Conference where the world renowed Psychologist come together to share knowledge, present ongoing/completed research materials and discuss emerging mental issues. This conference holds annually, on site and online and ideas generated in this conference are employed in real world situations.

I love Psychology, discussions on mental health, the impacts and ways which these health hazards can be mitigated, hence the choice for the project personalization.
